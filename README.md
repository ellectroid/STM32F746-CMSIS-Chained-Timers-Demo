# STM32F746-Chained-Timers-Demo
Demonstration of chaining 4 times, that activate one another in different ways.

Clock: 216MHz; 25MHz external oscillator with PLL.<br>
LED on PI1.<br>
PB4, PI0 and PB15 (Disco board's ARD D3, D5, D11 respectively)
<br><br>


This project is a proof of concept (that I can).

Might be useful for someone who wants to figure out how the stuff works.
I commented almost every line to make it simple to understand.
